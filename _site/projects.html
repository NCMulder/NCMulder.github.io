<h2 id="ptswgd"><a href="https://hdjkleissen.github.io/PTSWGD/">PTSWGD</a><image src="assets/images/ptswgd.png" height="100" align="right"></image></h2>
<p><a href="https://hdjkleissen.github.io/PTSWGD/">PTSWGD</a> is a group of (former) CS students working together to develop a game in Unity. I’m programming parts of the game, as well as the project site. In this role, I’ve learned how to set up a GitHub page (knowledge I’m using RIGHT NOW to create this website) using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Tinkering with Jekyll and GitHub pages has been fun (and a bit frustrating at times).</p>

<h2 id="iclon-dal-reporter">ICLON DAL Reporter</h2>
<p>For the <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/iclon">ICLON</a> (Leiden University Graduate School of Teaching), I’m currently working on an application that automates the pipeline for aggregating course evaluation data. In this role, I’ve been working with <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> (for user selection, UI and output generation) and <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> (for data fetching). Users can select what faculty, course and period to evaluate and can save the results in a few preset (Excel) reports.</p>

<h2 id="groep200"><a href="http://groep200.nl/">Groep200</a></h2>
<p>Can’t tell you anything more about this right now, sorry!</p>

<h2 id="archie"><a href="https://github.com/NCMulder/Archie">Archie</a><image src="assets/images/archie.png" align="right"></image></h2>
<p>For the <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/archaeology">Faculty of Archaeology</a> of Leiden University I developed a metadata generation/aggregation tool. This tool, written in <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html">Java</a>, automates metadata collection for (large) datasets in compliance with the <a href="https://dans.knaw.nl/en">KNAW Dans - sword format</a>. To accomplish this, Archie evaluates a dataset on metadata, offers an overview where users can add and edit certain data (with the option to propagate the changes through underlying files) and offers multiple export options for depositing in different repositories.</p>

<h1 id="games-and-gamejams">Games and gamejams</h1>

<h2 id="robotory">Robotory</h2>
<p>Together with <a href="https://github.com/YannickMeijer">Yannick Meijer</a>, I created a silly puzzling game in a week while learning Unity. It utilizes pathfinding, a weird story and funky controls. (That’s a good save for having terrible controls, right?). You can find a copy <a href="/assets/downloads/robotory.exe">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="evil-shapeshifters">Evil Shapeshifters</h2>
<p>Together with <a href="http://dreamfuelgames.com/About-Me/">Jorim van der Wal</a>, I created a simple and short game over the course of a weekend. It’s very rough around the edges (why did I choose that font for the UI?), but I got to work with <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb200104(v=XNAGameStudio.40).aspx">XNA</a> again after some time of not touching it. It was probably the last time I will ever use it, seeing as MonoGame is a thing now (and Unity is quite a bit nicer to work with anyway).</p>

<h1 id="other-random-stuff">Other random stuff</h1>

<h2 id="roll-a-game">Roll-a-game</h2>
<p>Ever wanted to play a game with some friends but couldn’t decide what? That happened a little bit too often to me. I wrote a simple <a href="https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro">Discord bot</a> using JavaScript that selects a random game from a list to decide for you, and sends a Steam link. It can select on some properties (mainly length), and the list can be added to through Discord.</p>

<h2 id="draft-viewer-improver">Draft Viewer Improver</h2>
<p>As discussed on the <a href="about_me">about me</a> page, I have a bit of an obsession with Magic: The Gathering. Whenever a Pro Tour is on, some of the draft pods are published online, pick-by-pick. While this is pretty cool, the tool is old and has a terrible UI. I wrote a small JavaScript bookmark thingy that automatically cycles through showing a pick and going to the next pick/pack/player (and hiding the pick).</p>
