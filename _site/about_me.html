      <h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>

<p>Hi! I’m Niels Mulder, a CS bachelor student at Utrecht University. I started studying Astrophysics in 2014, and switched to Computer Science in the following year. While looking at the stars and discovering oxygen on some far away Earth-like planet had always been a dream, Computer Science has proven to be a better fit for me since it’s a little bit more hands on. In the past few years, I’ve learned about the basics of Computer Science, I wrote a raytracer, I dipped my toes in artificial intelligence, I wrote some data processing programs for Leiden University, and I followed a Gamedesign minor at the HKU.</p>

<p>Within informatics, I like learning new languages. While my German has deteriorated to a level where I’m embarrassed trying to speak it, I’ve become somewhat fluent in quite a few programming languages. My main focus has been on C# and Python, but I’ve also worked quite extensively with Java and Kotlin and JavaScript and JQuery, and I gained some basic understanding of C++ (which I would like to expand upon) and Haskell.</p>

<p>I have created a few games using XNA and Unity, and currently I’m working with Jekyll to create some basic websites, and with ASP.net to create somewhat more extensive sites.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I like playing games. I mostly enjoy multiplayer games and boardgames, and I’ve been a little bit obsessed with Magic: The Gathering lately.</p>
